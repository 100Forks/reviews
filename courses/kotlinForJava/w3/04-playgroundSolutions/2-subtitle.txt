In this task, we need to
define a variable so that the first cast returned a safe cast returned as
null and the second one, customer novel type
throw an exception. This task is a good illustration
for the difference between safe cast and there are goal cast
to our novel type. Any variable that stores not an integer value
will do the job. So for instance, in
this example you define a string, and after that, if you just use safe cast, then you get null as a result because that's
how safe cast work. If it doesn't cast, it's
simpler transfer null. But the difference with
the custom novel type is that if your variable cannot
be casted to a novel type, then you'll have here cost cast exception that
the cost is impossible. So there's the difference between this safe cast and
the customer novel type.
