>> When does it make sense to declare your own function as 'inline'? >> So, it can be very tempting to use inline functions for performance optimization in your code. But here's where I have to warn you against optimizing prematurely. Most of the time, you don't really need inline functions in your application code. If you really see that something is affecting your performance, here is what inlining is good for. So, first of all, since virtual machines are really good at inlining at runtime, you don't really need inlining for eliminating stack frames. So, it's not for having less calls. What is good for it is to eliminate allocations of lambda objects. So, if you have a higher-order function that takes a lambda, and you are calling it somewhere in tight loop, for example, and allocations really affect your performance, you can optimize this away using inlining. But again, use it with a lot of care. There are other use cases for inline functions, but they will be covered in the next chapter of this course (the next course).
