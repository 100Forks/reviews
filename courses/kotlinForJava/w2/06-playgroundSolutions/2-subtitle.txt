In this task, we need to
change some functions, so it was defined
as an extension. Because I use Intellij, I can two-tier and
call an action, convert parameter
to receiver that automatically will
do the job for me. I'm going to section, and let's see what has changed. At first, row function is
defined as an extension, so our list became the receiver. Now, we access this list by this reference inside
the function body, and also the way how we call
the function changed because now we call it as an extension. It looks like it was a member. Note that there is
a word detection also in sake and virtual server
two parameter or you can use this convert
parameter through a searing and literacy
search parameters for your own functions
as well when you, for instance, want to convert a regular function
to an extension.
