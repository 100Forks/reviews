### <a name="cs50"></a> Harvard's CS50 (first half)
This was my first course. In 2018 this was the "intro/beginner" course on OSSU curriculum. For the sake of completeness I took the whole course at once, including the [second half](#cs50-2). It's pretty challenging for a beginner course, because that's how Harvard does it. In terms of college course numbering, they go with 050 but it feels more like a 200-level class.

The course uses an online IDE which was really top-notch in my opinion. They even invented their own version of the C compiler that gives more "beginner-friendly" and more helpful error messages. They created a much more beginner-friendly version of the "man-pages" for C. They even teach you how to use "valgrind", a code analysis/memory leak detection tool that even some pros don't know or use.

For me the assignments were at the right level of difficulty. Even though it uses C and gets into low-level matters of memory management, it was not too difficult. Yes, initially pointer arithmetic and pointer logic is gonna drive you crazy, but you'll get used to it. Each assignment had 2 versions called "more" and "less", meaning more comfortable or less comfortable with programming. "More" versions are the more challenging ones if I remember correctly, which I preferred to do. Assignments were: Scratch (a visual, block-based programming language for kids), displaying some text, breaking ciphers, credit card number verification, image decoding, image resizing, dictionary word search and more. Really throws lots of different types of problems and file/data types at you! Very good variation for a beginner course.

The instructor David Malan is very energetic and fun, but I really disliked the 1.5 hour long lecture videos recorded in a lecture hall. The lectures were not very useful when doing the assignments. But they had separate much shorter "helper" videos for the assignments, done by the TAs; those were very helpful. The assignments had super long wordy text descriptions that I disliked. It was usually more difficult to decipher all that text than doing the assignments themselves.

I think it's a challenging beginner course. These days Python is the preferred language for beginner courses (which is covered in the second half), but if you want to baptize yourself in fire, you can jump into this course.
